<h2>So what kind of articles do we publish?</h2>

<div class="divPara">
    <p>We know it is challenging to cover all the important issues, to invest resources in research and disseminate important news quickly and accurately â€“ especially for independent reporting trying to overcome the right-wing and conservative media paradigm.

    So all articles published, can be republished for free, either translated or in the original language. You can use them for commercial and non-commercial purposes. You do not need to ask permission from or provide any credit.</p>
